    "## Proximal Policy Optimization\n",
    "Proximal Policy Optimization, or PPO, is one of the most widely used Reinforcement Learning algorithms. It is both simple, and highly effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "PPO uses two neural networks, one is called the Actor, given a state, it returns the probability that the agent will take each action. The second neural network is called the Critic which takes a state, and returns the expected reward for said state. By combining these two networks, the Critic can help tell the Actor whether it took a good or bad action, allowing the program to learn faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trajectories\n",
    "In order to train, PPO must first collect a series of trajectories. The complete set of state, actions, and rewards for an episode played by the agent. In general, the more trajectories collected before the agent is updated, the faster the agent will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "# Clipped Loss Function\n",
    "One problem with almost all Reinforcement Learning algorithms is that they are highly unstable. When a large update is made to the policy, there is a chance for the change to be too big and greatly harm the performance. To fix this, PPO uses the clipped loss function shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$min((\\frac{\\pi}{\\pi_{old}})A(s,a),clip(\\frac{\\pi}{\\pi_{old}},1-\\varepsilon,1+\\varepsilon))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "PPO introduces a clipping term to the loss function, taking away the incentive to change the loss function too much. This way, if the ratio of the current action probability over the old action probability is greater than 1 + epsilon, or less than 1 - epsilon, the loss function will not encourage the policy to increase or decrease respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generalized advantage estimation\n",
    "In the loss function showed above, the Advantage function was shown, in the version of PPO I implemented, I used Generalized Advantage Estimation in order to calculate the advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generalized advantage estimation is method for estimating an advantage function that combines the discounted rewards, which usually vary greatly but are generally accurate, with the outputs from the Critic Network, which vary much less, but are less accurate than the discounted rewards. It has been shown that by finding a balance between accuracy, and variance, it is possible for a reinforcement learning program to train much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Network Architecture\n",
    "The Policy Network has 2 hidden layers, both with a tanh activation and 64 neurons. Its input is size 33 vector, and its output is a size 4 vector. The output layer also has a tanh activation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Critic Network is the same, but it only has one output. The Critic Network's output layer also has a tanh activation. This was done because there was a low discount value, meaning the discounted rewards were usually in between 0 and 1.\n",
